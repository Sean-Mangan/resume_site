        about: 'Hey there! My name is Sean Mangan and I am currently a student at the university of Minnesota and studying computer scienmce. I am very excited to report that I will be graduating at the end of this current semester (Fall 2021) and even more excited to report that I am looking for employment afterwards.\n\nDespite being freshly graduated, I have plenty of experience in software development. From researching in an academic setting in Oslo (SINTEF) to providing VAN operations here in Minneapolis (SPS commerce) to even helping fellow students as a TA, it feels as if I have seen it all. But I am ready to put even more on my plate and put some more notches on my belt.\n\nPlease reach out if you are at all interested in meeting with me to see if I would be a good fit for your team. I am very excited to work with you in the future!',
